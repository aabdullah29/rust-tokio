In this example we just sepret our function and enum in sepret files like:
1. `time.ts` we place the sleep function in this file
2. `message.ts` we place the message enum in this file
3. `message_generator.ts` we place message_generator function in this file
4. `file_sink.ts` we place the file_sink function in this file
5. `main.ts` in this file we use the all files and their functions
